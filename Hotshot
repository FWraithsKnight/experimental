Strange Orion build based on nomadic need to be able to survive alone.
Multifunction build designed as an attempt to get bayonet and Great swords to reach a point of synergy
Different to use, difficult to get everything, unique resource management challenge, unbalanced, opening gamble against bosses determines win or lose due to wind up time and recovery time being terribly long, if opener fails user will be vulnerable for extended period to recover ichor typically resulting in death multiple times from low health pool allowing some bosses and elite enemies to sneeze kill you
Can be very high damaging without using any buffs but attacks from sword are sluggish and bayonet is there for range
Bayonet gift is hitscan, not as reliable as fusillade but has potential to do outrageous amounts of damage if shot lands in certain areas but does less than half damage on grazing hit
